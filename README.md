# imaging_bluesky

Bluesky plans and tools for the Imaging Group

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

Source          | <https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/imaging-bluesky>
:---:           | :---:
PyPI            | `pip install imaging-bluesky`
Docker          | `docker run ghcr.io/diamondlightsource/imaging-bluesky:latest`
Releases        | <https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/imaging-bluesky/releases>

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from imaging_bluesky import __version__

print(f"Hello imaging_bluesky {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m imaging_bluesky --version
```
